## What is Nano ?

The goal of Nano is to create an efficient cryptocurrency, one that could be used for daily payments, by anyone in the world, without the emissions that come with Bitcoin.
Nano makes money efficient for a more equal world — simple to pay with, easy to accept and open to all.

- Nano is a fee-less cryptocurrency, making it practical and inclusive for everyone in the world.
- Without relying on mining, printing or minting, Nano is sustainable digital money.
- Every Nano is distributed, making it a deflationary currency.
- Instant and secure, a transaction is fully confirmed on the network under 1 second(sometimes 30 minute+).

## Languages

The language set in the Browser determines the language that NanoLooker will load and default to `en` if it's not in the supported list. Since most languages were generated using Google Translation API, some translations may be inaccurate.

Many of the most common languages are supported.

- English (en)
- Français (fr)
- Español (es)
- العربية (ar)
- Deutsch (de)
- فارسی (fa)
- हिन्दी (hi)
- Italiano (it)
- 日本語 (ja)
- 한국어 (ko)
- Nederlands (nl)
- Polski (pl)
- Português (pt)
- Pусский (ru)
- Türkçe (tr)

### Contribution

If you think some strings should be corrected open a PR with the corrections on the [language file](https://github.com/running-coder/nanolooker/tree/master/src/i18n/locales).

### Adding a new language or missing language keys

- Setup a Google translate API key at https://cloud.google.com/translate
- Add a file named `translate.json` at the root (same level as `package.json`) with your API credentials from Google
- Link that file using its path inside the `.env` under the key `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=translate.json`
- run `npm run translate -- --language=LANGUAGE_CODE` where `LANGUAGE_CODE` is `ru`, `fr`, `es` or any new language supported by Google's API.
- run `npm run translate` to generate for all languages found in the `src/i18n/locale` from `en.json`
