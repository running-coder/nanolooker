    "votingWeight": "An account with a minimum of {{minWeight}} NANO or >= 0.1% of the online voting weight delegated to it is required to get the Principal Representative status.

    "nakamotoCoefficient": "The Nakamoto coefficient is a way to quantify the decentralization of a blockchain or other decentralized system.

    "cemented": "When a specific node marks a confirmed transaction as locally irreversible by setting the account's confirmation height (in the node database) to the now higher block height of the confirmed transaction. Cementing is a node-level operation.",
    "unknownLastTransaction": "Transaction dates were introduced in February 2019. Prior to that date, the transaction times were not recorded locally on the nodes. The reason why the last transaction date is unknown is because it was confirmed before the dates were recorded or before the NanoLooker node was in service.",
