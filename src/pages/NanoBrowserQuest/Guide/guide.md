# Introduction

Nano BrowserQuest is based on the orginal BrowserQuest game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowserQuest. It started out as a fork that was identical in gameplay to the original, while integrating Nano (XNO) cryptocurrency transactions. The fork is created by running-coder (also known for creating and maintaining the website https://nanolooker.com/) as a way to promote awareness of the XNO currency. The original idea is similar to that of a faucet website which regularly pays out a small amount of cryptocurrency, commonly involving the user solving captchas or similar tasks. Nano BrowserQuest intended to make the process fun by allowing the user to play a game instead of performing menial tasks to recieve a micro payout in XNO.
Since it's inception Nano BrowserQuest has been developed into a more complete experience as running-coder steadly improves and expands the game. Bugs from the original game have been fixed, several new items have been implemented and last but not least a big expansion pack is available for purchase.

# Expansions

## Freezing Lands Expansion Released on [Dec 30, 2021](https://running-coder.medium.com/nanobrowserquest-freezing-lands-2669d719f982)

![Freezing Lands](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19352322/231320633-2724023b-b0c9-45fa-8832-f43d344600a1.png)

The expansion is for free now and it extends the game significantly. It features an all new map with a winter theme, including new enemies and two new bosses to defeat. There is also a bonus map with it's own boss, and recently a brand new "mega-boss". Beyond this a copious amount of new items and upgrades are available with cool animations and hidden attributes making the player ready to take on the more hardcore challenges present in new stages of the game.

## Secret Level

[Feb 5, 2022](https://medium.com/@running-coder/nanobrowserquest-secret-level-89bcedf1fd16)

![Secret Level](https://miro.medium.com/v2/format:webp/1*tZW26Kdu2og_9aFfZUk_3g.png?width=400px)

Bonus Level Included in the Freezing Lands expansion, this secret level requires level 45 to enter and is opened by **three** ingredients mixed in the anvil to create the red portal.

## The Lost Temple Released on [Mar 30 2023](https://running-coder.medium.com/ba-nanobrowserquest-the-lost-temple-expansion-9339c1d29268)

![The Lost Temple](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19352322/231320692-412809fe-9e32-4466-bc27-bbb4473336da.png)

This remarkable update brings new content and game mechanics, including minibosses, sockets, and runewords, adding excitement and depth to the gameplay.
The new world features new Waypoints, many new bosses and various secrets.

There are new offensive skills that can be activated by hovering over an enemy and pressing the '1' key. To utilize this skill, you must first equip a weapon imbued with the spell as an attribute.

The addon can be purchased by the red wizard for XNO ![XNO](https://nanobrowserquest.com/img/3/xno.png)
or BAN ![BAN](https://nanobrowserquest.com/img/3/ban.png)
depending on what version of the game you're in.

# Waypoint

![Waypoints Panel](https://github.com/running-coder/nanolooker/assets/19352322/fe61b4c1-2908-42ee-8b03-acc0162650d1?width=450px&display=inline-block)![Waypoint](https://github.com/running-coder/nanolooker/assets/19352322/f798ac89-5b9f-4fda-8816-24397a143125?width=200px&display=inline-block)

The waypoints are used for fast map traveling. Some are locked, but once you find and click them, they'll unlock. The first three waypoints are used to travel the 'Classic' map. The Skeleton King is located north in the Volcanic Mountain. Once the boss is killed, the next three waypoints for the 'Freezing Lands' expansion will unlock for free. After you beat the Necromancer, to unlock the 'Woodlands Lost Temple' expansion waypoint, you'll have to purchase the expansion from the red sorcerer in town for XNO/BAN.

# Gold System

## Released on [Apr 25 2023](https://running-coder.medium.com/ba-nanobrowserquest-gold-system-1b603de7162e)

![{"name": "Gold"}](https://nanobrowserquest.com/img/3/item-gold3.png)
In-game gold can be obtained from any mobs and is used for trading items with other players. Join the [Discord #price-discussion channel](https://discord.gg/n2nEBVZrjE) for more information. The harder or higher-level the mob, the more gold it can drop. You can also increase the gold dropped from mobs using items with the **+#% Extra Gold from Enemies** stat, such as Goldwrap, Amulet of Greed, Ring of Greed, or various other items. When you loot gold, it is added to your inventory. However, if you don't store it in your personal Stash and you die, you'll lose half as a death penalty, and that gold will go to Janet Yellen's bank to pay for the redeemed IOUs. If the gold is in your personal Stash, you won't lose any upon death, so be sure to return to town and stash your gold periodically.

## Aim of the game

The aim of the basic game (without the expansion pack) is basically to defeat the Skeleton King and recieve a small XNO payout. This is done by exploring the original map and killing enemies to gain experience and loot. The player levels up and gets stronger with the experience gained from slaying enemies until he/she is ready to take on the Skeleton King. Higher level enemies are harder to kill but also give more EXP as well as better loot. The player can upgrade items in the anvil present in the village where the game starts out. This is done by putting the appropriate level of upgrade scroll into the anvil along with the item which the player aims to upgrade. Further description regarding the anvil can be found here: https://nanolooker.com/nanobrowserquest/. Completing achievements will increase the final XNO payout recieved by the player, so aim to get all of them filled before killing the Skeleton King. Venture in all directions, find secret items, fun NPCs and achievments before heading north to kill the final boss.

With the addition of expansion packs, the game ceases to funktion as a faucet. The price of getting the latest expansion is higher than the Skeleton King payout so players should be aware that going beyond the original game is meant for those who truely enjoy it. Having come this far, the aim is simply enjoyment of the game itself and the community. While progressing in the game and killing bosses are the main aims of the expansion, dedicated players also enjoy farming for rare loot and maxing out their character.

# Nano BrowserQuest item guide

This is a guide to all of the items that you can find in NBQ, their basic stats, where to find them and how common/rare they are.

Most items have a unique version with better/more stats. Weapons, armors, belts and shields all have unique counterparts. There is a 1% chance of receiving a unique version when an item is dropped. Amulets and rings have counterparts and also what is categorized as "super-uniques" in this guide. These are very rare items with attributes that are unique to this categoy.

The items are listed in order of stats (Low - High) with exception for super uniques as they have attributes which are useful in different situations and cannot be ranked.

Items can be upgraded by using the anvil in the village. As an item is upgraded, all stats will get a higher number.

# Attributes explained

## Defensive attributes

**Health**
Basic player health that determines how much damage can be taken

**Defense**
Basic defense stat, blocks a part of an enemy hit making health drop less (small bonus increase with player level)

**Absorbed damage**
Similar to defense it absorbs a part of an enemy hit making health drop less

**Health regeneration per second**
Regenerates players health per second at a specific rate. It is a fixed amount added on top of the default % regeneration rate of (maxHp / 33) per second so if you have 330 max hp and use a +12 regen per second, you'll then regen 22hp per second

**Block**
Blocks a hit from enemy. No damage done if blocked. Random chance based on %

**-% Chance of being frozen**
The attribute lessens the risk of being frozen by enemies that are cold enchanted

**Defensive skill**
Defensive skills add a defensive attribute to shields which is activated by pressing "2". Dropped shields have one of three random attributes which are: "Increased % defense for x seconds", % Instant health regeneration or % All resistance for x seconds. The % increases with the items level.

**Elemental resistance**
Just like some enemies, the player can also be resistant to elemental damage. Certain items carry a % resistance against the five different elements present in the game. As an example, this means that if a player has 50% total resistance towards Flame damage, a hit of 100 Flame damage will only do 50 damage points.

## Discussion

**Defense vs Absorbed damage**

Defense and Absorbed damage do basically the same thing, blocking a portion of an enemy hit to make the players health decrease less when attacked. The difference between the two attributes is that Absorbed damage gives a higher protection at lower item levels. For example at level +5 an item with Absorbed damage would give the player 10 Absorbed points while the same item with the Defense attribute would only give 8. This is evened out at level +7 (both attributes will give 15 points). Given the bonus that Defense gives based on player level, this stat would be desirable compared to Absorbed damage if the player aims to upgrade the item to +7 or higher.

**Special use of Absorbed damage in PVP**

Absorbed damage has a special use when fighting against other players because of the "Defense" attribute (which mobs in PVE do not have). Absorbed damage is the only thing that can block the "Pierce armor attack" attribute.

## Offensive attributes

**Attack**
Basic Damage dealt by player. both min and max damage increases when items with attack attribute are equipped (small bonus increase with player level)

**Elemental damage**
Both min and max damage increase. Higher amount of damage compared to regular attack, however enemies can be immune or resistant to these attributes. Elemental damage attributes come in both normal "damage points" as well as in %. The idea is that if the player has high points on a certain element he/she should equip items with the same elemental % bonus to get as big of a boost as possible.

The five different elements of NBQ are: Magic, Flame, Cold, Poison, Lightning.

**Minimum damage**
Minimum damage increase

**Maximum damage**
Maximum damage increase

**Critical hit**
Hits enemy with higher damage. Random chance based on %

**Pierce armor attack**
Deals a high level of physical damage (similar to Attack with a much higher number but without the player level bonus). Enemies cannot be resistant to physical damage

**Offensive (ranged) skill**
Offensive skills add an offensive attribute to the players weapon. It is activated by pressing "1" while hovering over an enemy with the mouse. There are five different random attributes that can be found on dropped weapons, based on the different elemental attacks: Magic, Flame, Cold, Lightning and Poison.

**Increased attack speed**
Increases the players attack speed a certain % and makes the player do damage faster.

**Weapon weights**

| Weapon weights | attack bonus | attack speed | Description                                                                                                  |
| :------------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| light          | -15%         | +20%         | light weapons such as daggers and hatchets                                                                   |
| normal         | 0%           | 0%           | regular weapons such as swords                                                                               |
| heavy          | +25%         | -15%         | some mauls and other big looking weapons                                                                     |
| Super heavy    | +35%         | -20%         | huge looking weapons slow but high dmg weapons(the dmg is massiveif you can add yourself attack speed items) |

**% Lower elemental resistance**
This attribute lowers resistance to elemental damage by a certain %. For example, an enemy that is 50% resistant to Flame damage would only be 40% resistant if the player has an item with 10% equipped. An enemy that is immune to Flame damage would in the same case only be 90% resistant. This only affects the attacks of the player with "Lower elemental resistance" equipped. The attribute exists for all individual elements as well as in "Lower all resistance" form.

**+% Prevent enemy health regeneration**
Curses enemy for a certain amount of time, preventing them from regenerating health.

## Discussion

**Attack vs Elemental vs Min/Max**

Elemental damage beats attack at lower player levels because of the higher number per item level. However, as the player starts to level up, the Attack added from an item will be higher than indicated by the number because the attribute has a bonus based on the players level. Enemies can also be immuned to Elemental damage, making regular Attack a more reliable attribute. Min/Max are beaten by both of the other attributes as they only add half of the damage, making them worse attributes in almost all cases. The only exception would be when fighting an enemy that is immuned/resistant to a specific Elemental damage.

Lightning & Poison damage work slightly different compared to Magic and Flame (and atleast for now, Cold as well). Lightning is unique as it deals ordinary damage as well as damage when hit by enemies. This is great when being attacked by multiple enemies as it deals damage to alla of them. The exception to this is when Lightning is used as an offensive skill with ranged attack. Poison is special because it continues to do damage after the initial hit as long as the enemy is poisoned.

**Special use of Elemental & Pierce armor attack in PVP**

Both Elemental damage and Pierce armor attack bypass the defense attribute completely. The only thing that stops Elemental damage is the elemental resistance of the other player. Pierce armor attack is only blocked by the other players "Absorbed damage" attribute.

## Superunique attributes

**Drain life**
Deals damage to an enemy and also adds the same amount back to players health

**Super health/High hp bonus**
Same as normal health stat but much higher

**Freeze**
Freeze enemy for x seconds making them unable to attack you

## Various

**Experience**
Added experience % making the player level up faster

**Magic Find**
If a potion was to drop, the game regerate a random drop based on z giving you a higher chance of getting an item.

**+% Extra gold from from enemies**
Adds extra % from gold drops

## Sockets

Some items can drop with a certain amount of sockets (Weapons, Armors, Shields and Helms) and the possible number of sockets are 0-6 (0-3 for helms). Amounts are randomized at every drop with lower % chance for every added socket. Sockets can also be re-randomized with Socket Stones (no risk) or Transmute Scrolls (risk of burning). This is explained in more detail below under the Socket Stone category. Sockets can be used to fit either runes or skull jewels to strengthen the players item.

**Tips on fitting your sockets**

1. Do not socket items that have yet to be upgraded to the desired level as everything in the sockets will be destroyed if the main item is burned in the anvil.
2. As a general rule: do not put individual runes in your sockets or mix with skull jewels. Instead save your runes to create full runewords.
3. Unique items can not use runewords, instead use skull jewels only.
4. Skull jewels come in 5 different levels with unique versions inbetween every level. Use Lower skulls for lower items or as a temporary boost. Only put your most precious skulls into items that are fully upgraded and good enough to be used for a longer time. Lower level skulls will become more common as the player progresses in the game. Put these in you sockets to gain a boost and then remove them with Socket Stones to later replace them with higher skulls or runewords.
5. If your item is fully upgraded but you lack the number of higher level skulls needed to fit all sockets, put the higher skulls in first, followed by lower ones. This is to prevent burning the higher ones when it's time to re-fit your sockets, as items are removed from the last one added.

# Weapons

**Unique Weapon** drop rate is 1% meaning that out of 100 looted weapons, 1 should be unique.

![Pets](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/971429295186665536/1133456298923528192/pet-teaser.gif)

Pets can be bought for XNO from the Red Wizard in the village and so far do not drop anywhere in the game. They are bought as an egg and can be hatched at the Anvil and transformed into a random pet. They come in many different shapes and colors and can also be upgraded in levels like other items. The look of the pet is random and when equipped they give one randomized attribute to the player. There is a 1% chance of getting a unique pet which has double attributes.

# Scrolls

These items are used to upgrade the items found in NBQ. It is done by putting the item into the anvil in the village. The item is put in the left square and the scroll in one of the middle squares of the anvil. One of the squares is "lucky" and will grant the player an extra % chance of success. The upgraded item (if successful) will emerge in the right square.

Chance is random, higher socket numbers being less likely. Once an item has 3 or more sockets (4 on unique items), the stones will no longer work. At this point the player will have to use a Transmute Scroll with 25% risk or Blessed Transmute with 1% risk of burning the item. |

# Lost Temple Secret special quests

NBQ has quite a lot of secrets and hidden areas, most of which are connected to various achievements. Hints of how to find some secrets can be found in crypts, engraved into tombs. The two most important ones are the Obelisk of Eternal Life and the Book of Azreal (Grimoir).

# Skull Jewels

Skull Jewels come in 5 different levels: level 1 (white), level 2 (white), level 3 (white & blue), level 4 (gray) and level 5 (gold). Similar to other items, Skull Jewels also exist in unique form with a 1% drop chance. Unique versions have an extra attribute added, making them stronger than their regular counterpart. Compared to a higher level skull, a unique (lower) skull is still slightly weaker (same amount of attributes but not as high).

# Party chat commands

The game features a global chat system for players to keep in touch and a party system enabling players to team up. When in a party, the players help eachother and recieve loot in a turn-based sequence. Other perks to playing in a party includes shared EXP and the fact that items dropped by an enemy killed by a party cannot be looted by other players. Capes which can be bought at the same place as the expansion give the player a powerful boost in stats when joined to a party of atleast one other player.

To Invite someone, you right click them and select "Party". When someone invites you to a party you get a message in the chat and the sword Icon on the bottom right will light up.

There are the following party commands as well for those who prefer to use the console.

```
/party create
/party invite playerName (as the party leader)
/party join partyId (as the invitee)
/party leave
/party remove playerName (as the party leader)
/party disband (as the party leader)
```

# Tips & Tricks

1. When farming for rare items remember that unique counterparts look the same as the regular items. When searching/farming for a unique, remember to pick up items and check your inventory. Super uniques have a distinguishable skin but it is always a good idea to pick up drops as items can be hidden underneath one another. This is particularly important when dealing with drops of similar color e.g. Fountain of Youth having a similar color to Rejuvenation Potion.

2. Use items strategically. If facing a strong enemy or several weaker ones it is a good idea to equip items with defensive attributes. Sometimes attack can be the best defense, in particualr when dealing with several smaller enemies as the faster you take them out, the less damage is inflicted on you as they die. Items with randomized attributes can be switched to fill the needs of a specific situation. When dealing with one strong enemy that takes a long time to kill and also might be strong enough to kill the player/players, aim for defensive stats.

3. For dedicated farmers looking for rare items, a good strategy is to equip damage mods and find the weakest enemy that drops the desired item. Look for places where there are many of them, make sure that you are strong enough to survive a large amount of said enemies with attack-focused items, and finally run into them and kill them as fast as possible. Remember to pick up all dropped loot to see if there is anything good in your inventory. The Lightning damage attribute is excellent for this type of farming as it deals damage consistently to everything around you.

# Player base stats per lvl

When leveling up, your character gets stronger (the higher your level, the more bonus stats (Attack, Defense, HP) you get):

- **Attack:** min and max dmg scales with the player level

```javascript
// Attack calculations
let minAttack =
  baseDamage + minDamage + Math.round(Math.pow(0.7, Math.floor(playerLevel / 10)) * playerLevel);
let maxAttack =
  baseDamage + maxDamage + Math.round(Math.pow(1.075, Math.floor(playerLevel / 10)) * playerLevel);
```

- **Defense:** scales with the player level

```javascript
// Defense calculations
let defense = baseDefense + Math.round(Math.pow(1.05, Math.floor(playerLevel / 10)) * playerLevel);
```

- **HP:** scales with the player level

```javascript
// HP calculations
let hp = baseHP(80) + 6 * playerLevel;
```

# Player base stats per lvl

When leveling up, your character gets stronger (the higher your level, the more bonus stats (Attack, Defense, HP) you get):

- **Attack:** min and max dmg scales with the player level

```javascript
// Attack calculations
let minAttack =
  baseDamage + minDamage + Math.round(Math.pow(0.7, Math.floor(playerLevel / 10)) * playerLevel);
let maxAttack =
  baseDamage + maxDamage + Math.round(Math.pow(1.075, Math.floor(playerLevel / 10)) * playerLevel);
```

- **Defense:** scales with the player level

```javascript
// Defense calculations
let defense = baseDefense + Math.round(Math.pow(1.05, Math.floor(playerLevel / 10)) * playerLevel);
```

- **HP:** scales with the player level

```javascript
// HP calculations
let hp = baseHP(80) + 6 * playerLevel;
```
